# powerfactory-python

DIgSILENT PowerFactory is a power system analysis simulation software that is commonly used by electrical engineer to conduct various electrical power system analysis. One common use case is for power flow/load flow calculation of a power grid. One advantage of using PowerFactory is that this program can be embedded with python code, so we can implement various automated operations in our power system simulation. We can also generate thousands of power flow calculation to make a power flow dataset that can be utilized for machine learning task.

Please first set up the PowerFactory configuration so that it can be embedded with python code. You can find the instruction in the PowerFactory manual book. The python code in this repo can be inserted to the python source code file.

Please first install openpyxl, a Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files, so we can store the data generated by the python source code to an excel file. This excel file can be used for other uses.

To install openpyxl you can type the following line to your terminal:
py -m pip install openpyxl

The default generated excel file can be found in this location:
