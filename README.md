Please first install openpyxl, a Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files, so we can store the data generated by the python source code to an excel file. This excel file can be used for other uses.

To install openpyxl you can type the following line to your terminal:
py -m pip install openpyxl

The default generated excel file can be found in this location:
C:\Users\{your pc name}\AppData\Local\Temp\PowerFactory.MrfN6dVP
